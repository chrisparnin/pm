Prospective memory helps us remember to perform an action in the future.  We often use physical locations and cues, 
to remember daily activities like taking pills, or walk the dog.  In digital spaces, there is often no equivalent device.

`PM` is a chrome extension that allows reminders to be contextually placed in a browser location.  
You could use a reminder to send a message to someone in gmail, make notes on a web app you are developing, 
github project page, or leave notes in places go when not working (reddit, hacker news, etc).

The reminder messages are stored online with the following services, meaning you can access from all your devices:

- [Remember the milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/)
- ...

A future feature will support providing an instance id, so you add more context: `work`, `study computer`, `laptop`, etc.
