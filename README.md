Prospective memory helps us remember to perform an action in the future.  We often use physical locations and cues, 
to remember daily activities like taking pills, or walk the dog.  In digital spaces, there is often no equivalent device.

`PM` is a chrome extension that allows reminders to be contextually placed in a browser location.  
You could use a reminder to send a message to someone in gmail, make notes on a web app you are developing, 
github project page, or leave "guilty" notes in places we go when not working (reddit, hacker news, etc).

The reminder messages are stored online with the following services, meaning you can access from all your devices:

- [Remember the milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/)
- ...
- [Create an issue to request new service intergration](https://github.com/chrisparnin/pm/issues)

A future feature will support providing an instance id, so you add more context: `work`, `study computer`, `laptop`, etc.

### Attaching a reminder

Just click the "PM" icon or hit "Ctrl+M" (mac) or "Ctrl+Shift+M" (windows), type a reminder, and attach it to the page.

### Modifying reminders

* To edit, click on a reminder to bring up an edit box and update the text.
* To delete, hover over a reminder, and click the "x".  This will remove the reminder from remember the milk.
* To snooze, hover over a reminder, and click the "bell". A snoozed reminder will be hidden for the next 8 hours.  This willset a due date field, 8 hours from now.

### Reminder indicators

To help you notice reminders, the tab icon is updated with the number of reminders currently attached to a tab.
